2024-11-05T14:49:44.345Z [INFO] Duration: 4 minutes 19 seconds

===== FAILURE SUMMARY =====
Failed Job: model-validation
Failed Step: Validate model metrics
Exit Code: 1
Error Type: Model performance validation error
Root Cause: Model inference latency (245ms) exceeds production threshold (200ms)
Details:
  - Accuracy: 0.92 ✓
  - F1-Score: 0.91 ✓
  - Latency: 245ms ✗ (22.5% over threshold)

Recommendation: Optimize model inference or adjust latency threshold

===== SUBSEQUENT JOBS SKIPPED =====
- build-container (skipped due to dependency failure)
- deploy-staging (skipped due to dependency failure)
- deploy-production (skipped due to dependency failure)

===== WORKFLOW STATISTICS =====
Total Duration: 4 minutes 19 seconds
Jobs Completed: 0/4
Jobs Failed: 1/4
Jobs Skipped: 3/4
Total Cost: $0.087
Runner Time: 259 seconds
Time spent downloading dependencies: 346 seconds (133% of total runtime)
Cache miss impact: +346 seconds (pip dependencies)

===== PERFORMANCE ISSUES DETECTED =====
1. Cache miss on pip dependencies added 5.8 minutes
2. Large ML dependencies (torch 887MB) downloaded from scratch
3. No layer caching for Docker build (skipped due to failure)
4. Model validation latency suggests need for quantization or optimization
